Update: This extension worked as planned, but changes to the Crate and Barrel methods of shipping has since made this obsolete.

A Chrome Extension made for the sole specific purpose of copying Customer Shipping Information from Crate and Barrel’s App400 website and pasting it directly into Fedex’s Create Shipment page. Rather than typing it in off a shipping label, this extension will save a decent amount of employee time while also removing the possibility of errors through typos.

## To Use

After installing the extension, pin it to your Chrome. With your active tab inside any Customer Order with shipping information, click the extension icon then the large green Copy/Paste button. An alert should popup to confirm the data it stored.

With that done simply swap tabs over to any blank FedEx shipping page and click the same Copy/Paste button as before. All the data should be spit out into the correct fields instantly.

All data is cleared from the extension after pasting and will need to be copied again from the App400 if the user wishes to paste it again.
